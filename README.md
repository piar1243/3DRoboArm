Hello,

Attachd are files for the 3D model of the robotic arm so you can 3D print it, and the code scripts for ros and arduino are
also there.

BUILD AT YOUR OWN RISK, I AM STILL REFINING MANY ERRORS WITHIN THE 3D MODEL THAT I FIXED PHYSICALLY AND NOT ON THE MODEL
YET. ALSO, I AM CHANGING THE MODEL TO ADD INTERNAL WIRING. IM STILL WORKING ON UPLOADING THE ENTIRE ROS ROBOT PROFILE. 
ADITIONALLY, THE PID SYSTEM BETWEEN ROS AND ARDUINO IS STILL BEING REFINED SO THAT THE ESP32 MICROCONTROLLEE CAN BE
USED. FINALLY, MORE MODULAR PARTS ARE BEING WORKED ON AT THIS TIME.
